# Color Generator

## Motivation

## Example
We attempt to predict the colors associated with Red, Green, Blue, Python, and C. The results are shown below:

| ![](/images/red.png) | ![](/images/green.png) | ![](/images/blue.png) | ![](/images/python.png) | ![](/images/c++.png) |
|:--------------------:|:--------------------:|:--------------------:|:--------------------:|:--------------------:|

To run the code:
```
python3 main.py
```
Feel free to experiment with different text inputs to see how the model responds!

## References

This project is based on [this tutorial](https://fritz.ai/how-to-train-a-keras-model-to-generate-colors/). Some parts of the original code were outdated or deprecated, so I updated them to work with the latest version.
